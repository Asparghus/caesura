# <p style="text-align: center">caesura ùÑì</p>

An all-in-one command line tool to automate transcoding FLAC or FLAC 24 bit source torrent to MP3 320 (CBR) and MP3 V0 (VBR), then upload to gazelle based trackers.

## Features

All gazelle based indexers/trackers are supported
- RED
- **[[wip](https://github.com/RogueOneEcho/caesura/issues/7)]** OPS.

Tested on Linux, theoretically works on Windows.

Fully configurable, if there's something hard coded that you think should be configurable then open issue on GitHub.

### Source Verification

Each source is verified to ensure it's:
- A lossless FLAC
- Not a scene or lossy release
- Files match the torrent hash
- Audio tags for artist, album, title and track number are set
- **[[fixed](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide/issues/18)]** Vinyl track numbering
- Sample rate and channels are supported

### Spectrogram Generation

- Full and zoomed spectrograms generated for review

### Transcoding

- **[fixed]** Multi-threaded transcoding with optional CPU limit
- FLAC and FLAC 24 bit sources are supported
- FLAC, MP3 320 (CBR) and MP3 V0 (VBR) target formats
- Existing formats are skipped
- **[[fixed](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide/issues/21)]** Nested sub directories are fully supported (i.e. CD1, and CD2 etc)
- **[[fixed](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide/issues/22)]** Automatic naming following established conventions, with decoding of HTML entities.
- **[[fixed](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide/issues/24)]** Shorter file names.
- Automatic torrent file creation
- **[new]** Images in the root directory are included and all other files ignored.
- **[new]** Images larger than 750 KB are (optionally) compressed, converted to JPG and reduced to less than 1920 px. 

*The logic being that folder and cover images are included but to minimize file size, but for artwork and anything additional the original source can be downloaded*

### Upload

- Copy transcodes to content directory
- Copy torrent file to client auto-add directory

### Batch

- **[new]** Verify, transcode and upload from each torrent file in a directory. 

*The application will crunch through your torrent directory and automatically determine which are FLAC sources suitable for transcoding.*

## Getting started

The quickest path to get running is using docker compose, but that will require a little familiarity with docker. But the benefits are reproducability and peace of mind through isolation. 

### Install

#### Docker

1. Build

```bash
docker build -t caesura .
```

2. Run

```bash
docker run \
--user 1000:1000 \
-v ./path/to/your/config.json:/config.json \
-v /path/to/your/data:/data \
caesura verify "123456"
```

#### Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose run --rm caesura verify "123456"
```

#### Linux and MacOS

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

3. [Install Intermodal](https://github.com/casey/intermodal#installation)

```bash
cargo install imdl
```

4. Install FLAC, LAME, SOX and ImageMagick dependencies.

```bash
brew install flac lame sox imagemagick
```

5. Install caesura
```bash
cargo install caesura
```

#### Ubuntu

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. [Install Intermodal](https://github.com/casey/intermodal#installation)

```bash
cargo install imdl
```

3. Install FLAC, LAME, SOX and ImageMagick dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt install flac lame sox imagemagick --yes
```

4. Install caesura
```bash

### Configuration

Configuration options are sourced first from the command line arguments, then from a configuration file.

By default the application loads `config.json` from the current working directory, but this can be overridden with the `--config-path <CONFIG_PATH>` cli argument.

Most options have sensible defaults so the minimum required configuration is:

```json
{
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "output": "path/to/write/output",
    "content_directory": "path/to/your/torrent/content_or_downloads"
}
```

Full configuration:

```json
{
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "indexer": "abc",
    "indexer_url": "https://example.com",
    "tracker_url": "https://tracker.example.com",
    "content_directory": "path/to/your/torrent/content_or_downloads",
    "cpus": 6,
    "verbosity": "trace",
    "output": "path/to/write/output",

    "target": ["320", "v0", "flac"],
    "allow_existing": false,
    "skip_hash_check": false,
    "hard_link": false,
    "compress_images": false,
    
    "spectrogram_size": ["full", "zoom"],

    "copy_transcode_to_content_dir": false,
    "copy_torrent_to": "path/to/copy/torrent",
    "hard_link": false,
    
    "source": "123456"
}


```

## Releases and Changes

Release versions follow the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) specification.

Commit messages follow the [Conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

Releases and a full changelog are available via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/RogueOneEcho/caesura/releases).

## History

[**DevYukine**](https://github.com/DevYukine) completed the **initial work** and released it as [**red_oxide**](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide) under an [MIT license](LICENSE.HISTORIC.md).

[**RogueOneEcho**](https://github.com/RogueOneEcho) forked the project to complete a major refactor, **fix some issues**, add **new features** and improve logging and error handling. The fork is released as [**caesura**](https://github.com/RogueOneEcho/caesura) under an [AGPL license](LICENSE.md).

*The main difference between the former MIT license and the present AGPL license is that if you intend to distribute a modified version of the code - even to run it on a server - you must also provide the modified source code under an AGPL license.*

*This is often known as copyleft. The intent is to ensure that anyone taking advantage of this open source work are also contributing back to the open source community.*

The code base has now adopted [object oriented patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog) with SOLID principles and [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).
