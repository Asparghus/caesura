# <p style="text-align: center">caesura ùÑì</p>

An all-in-one command line tool to automate transcoding FLAC or FLAC 24 bit source torrent to MP3 320 (CBR) and MP3 V0 (VBR), then upload to gazelle based trackers.

## Features

All gazelle based indexers/trackers are supported
- RED
- **[[wip](https://github.com/RogueOneEcho/caesura/issues/7)]** OPS.

Tested on Linux, theoretically works on Windows.

Fully configurable, if there's something hard coded that you think should be configurable then open issue on GitHub.

### Source Verification

Each source is verified to ensure it's:
- A lossless FLAC
- Not a scene or lossy release
- Files match the torrent hash
- Audio tags for artist, album, title and track number are set
- **[[fixed](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide/issues/18)]** Vinyl track numbering
- Sample rate and channels are supported

### Spectrogram Generation

- Full and zoomed spectrograms generated for review

### Transcoding

- **[fixed]** Multi-threaded transcoding with optional CPU limit
- FLAC and FLAC 24 bit sources are supported
- FLAC, MP3 320 (CBR) and MP3 V0 (VBR) target formats
- Existing formats are skipped
- **[[fixed](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide/issues/21)]** Nested sub directories are fully supported (i.e. CD1, and CD2 etc)
- **[[fixed](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide/issues/22)]** Automatic naming following established conventions, with decoding of HTML entities.
- **[[fixed](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide/issues/24)]** Shorter file names.
- Automatic torrent file creation
- **[new]** Images in the root directory are included and all other files ignored.
- **[new]** Images larger than 750 KB are (optionally) compressed, converted to JPG and reduced to less than 1920 px. 

*The logic being that folder and cover images are included but to minimize file size, but for artwork and anything additional the original source can be downloaded*

### Upload

- Copy transcodes to content directory
- Copy torrent file to client auto-add directory

### Batch

- **[new]** Verify, transcode and upload from each torrent file in a directory. 

*The application will crunch through your torrent directory and automatically determine which are FLAC sources suitable for transcoding.*

## Getting started

Docker is the recommended way to run the application across all platforms.
- All dependencies are built into the image
- Runs in an isolated environment reducing risks to your system

### 0. Install Docker


[Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your OS.

### 1. Run the `help` command

Run the `help` command to see the available commands and options.

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/rogueoneecho/caesura --help
```

> [!TIP]
> Docker will automatically pull the latest version of the image in order to run it.

> [!TIP]
> You can append `--help` to any command to see the available options.
> 
> ```bash
> docker run ghcr.io/rogueoneecho/caesura verify --help
> ```

### 2. Create a configuration file

Run the `config` command to print the default configuration and redirect it to `config.json`.

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/rogueoneecho/caesura:latest config > config.json
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can ignore the "Failed to read config file" warning.

Edit `config.json` in your preferred text editor. Set the following fields for your indexer:
- `announce_url` Your personal announce URL. Find it on upload page.
- `api_key` Create an API key with `Torrents` permission `Settings > Access Settings > Create an API Key`
- `content_directory` the directory containing torrent content. Typically this is set as the download directory in your torrent client. Defaults to `./content`.
- `indexer` the id of the indexer: `red`, `pth`, `ops`.
- `indexer_url` the URL of the indexer: `https://redacted.ch`, `https://orpheus.network`.
- `output` the directory where transcodes, spectrograms and .torrent files will be written. Defaults to `./output`.

### 3. Verify a source

Run the `verify` command with the source as an argument.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the application is running in a Docker container, you need to mount the config file, content directory and output directory.

> [!TIP]
> For the source you can use a permalink, the numeric torrent id or a path to a torrent file:

```bash
docker run \
-v ./config.json:/config.json \
-v /path/to/your/content:/content \
-v ./output:/output \
ghcr.io/rogueoneecho/caesura \
verify https://redacted.ch/torrents.php?id=80518&torrentid=142659#torrent142659
```

If it looks good you can proceed to the next step, otherwise try another source.

### 4. Generate spectrograms of a source

Run the `spectrogram` command with the source as an argument.

```bash
docker run \
-v ./config.json:/config.json \
-v /path/to/your/content:/content \
-v ./output:/output \
ghcr.io/rogueoneecho/caesura \
spectrogram 142659
```

Inspect the spectrograms in the output directory.

### 5. Transcode a source

Run the `transcode` command with the source as an argument.

```bash
docker run \
-v ./config.json:/config.json \
-v /path/to/your/content:/content \
-v ./output:/output \
ghcr.io/rogueoneecho/caesura \
transcode "Khotin - Hello World [2014].torrent"
```

Inspect the transcodes in the output directory.

> [!TIP]
> Things to check:
> - Folder structure
> - File names
> - Tags
> - Audio quality
> - Image size and compression quality

### 6. Upload transcodes

Run the `upload` command with the source as an argument.

> [!TIP]
> Ideally you've already checked everything and nothing will go wrong but just in case there is a grace period after uploading in which you can remove the upload from your indexer.

> [!TIP]
> If you're unsure about this then you can append `--dry-run` to the command and instead of uploading it will print the data that would be submitted.

```bash
docker run \
-v ./config.json:/config.json \
-v /path/to/your/content:/content \
-v ./output:/output \
ghcr.io/rogueoneecho/caesura \
upload https://redacted.ch/torrents.php?id=80518&torrentid=142659#torrent142659
```

Go to your indexer and check your uploads to make sure everything has gone to plan.

### 7. Batch processing

Now that you have the hang of the application we can speed things up with the `batch` command.

This handles `verify`, `spectrogram`, `transcode` and `upload` in a single command. It can also be pointed at a directory containing torrent files to automatically sort through and pick out suitable sources.

We'll start off with some safeguards before setting it fully loose.
- `--limit 2` will stop the command after it has transcoded or uploaded from 2 sources.
- `--no-upload` will skip the upload step.

> [!NOTE]
> The batch command uses a cache file to store progress helping speed up subsequent runs.
> 
> Make sure the cache file is in a mounted volumes so it's not deleted between runs.

```bash
docker run \
-v ./config.json:/config.json \
-v /path/to/your/content:/content \
-v ./output:/output \
ghcr.io/rogueoneecho/caesura \
batch /path/to/your/torrents --limit 2 --no-upload
```

If everything goes to plan two sources should have transcoded to your output directory.

You can filter the cache file with `jq` to see what has been transcoded:

```bash
cat ./output/cache.json | jq 'map(select(.transcoded == true))'
```

Or to see what has been skipped and why:

```bash
cat ./output/cache.json | jq 'map(select(.skipped != null))'
```

If you're working with a lot of files then `less` can be helpful:

```bash
cat ./output/cache.json | jq --color-output 'map(select(.transcoded == true))' | less -R
```

For the first run we skipped the upload step with `--no-upload`.

Once you've checked the transcoded files you can run it again without `--no-upload`.

Or stick with `--no-upload` and remove the `--limit 2` to transcode every `.torrent` in the source directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I'd strongly recommend you always include an explicit `--limit` or `--no-upload` when running the batch command as you're likely to lose your upload privileges if you aren't paying attention to what you're uploading.

### Configuration

Configuration options are sourced first from the command line arguments, then from a configuration file.

By default the application loads `config.json` from the current working directory, but this can be overridden with the `--config-path <CONFIG_PATH>` cli argument.

Most options have sensible defaults so the minimum required configuration is:

```json
{
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "output": "path/to/write/output",
    "content_directory": "path/to/your/torrent/content_or_downloads"
}
```

Full configuration:

```json
{
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "indexer": "abc",
    "indexer_url": "https://example.com",
    "tracker_url": "https://tracker.example.com",
    "content_directory": "path/to/your/torrent/content_or_downloads",
    "cpus": 6,
    "verbosity": "trace",
    "output": "path/to/write/output",

    "target": ["320", "v0", "flac"],
    "allow_existing": false,
    "skip_hash_check": false,
    "hard_link": false,
    "compress_images": false,
    
    "spectrogram_size": ["full", "zoom"],

    "copy_transcode_to_content_dir": false,
    "copy_torrent_to": "path/to/copy/torrent",
    "hard_link": false,
    
    "source": "123456"
}
```


## Build

The getting started guide uses the pre-built Docker image but for increase privacy and assurance of what you're running you can easily build the application yourself with cargo.

### Dependencies

First you'll need to install the dependencies for your OS.

#### Windows

Just use Docker or ask ChatGPT. I imagine it's tedious.

#### MacOS and Linux with Homebrew

## History

[**DevYukine**](https://github.com/DevYukine) completed the **initial work** and released it as [**red_oxide**](https://github.com/DevYukine/red_oxide) under an [MIT license](LICENSE.HISTORIC.md).

[**RogueOneEcho**](https://github.com/RogueOneEcho) forked the project to complete a major refactor, **fix some issues**, add **new features** and improve logging and error handling. The fork is released as [**caesura**](https://github.com/RogueOneEcho/caesura) under an [AGPL license](LICENSE.md).

*The main difference between the former MIT license and the present AGPL license is that if you intend to distribute a modified version of the code - even to run it on a server - you must also provide the modified source code under an AGPL license.*

*This is often known as copyleft. The intent is to ensure that anyone taking advantage of this open source work are also contributing back to the open source community.*

The code base has now adopted [object oriented patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog) with SOLID principles and [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).
